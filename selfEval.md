# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled with the idea of printing out the entire object. I knew that console.log would print but I was not sure about the object. I decided to try console.log(nameOfVariableOfObject) such as console.log(zoo); and that printed the entire Object.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going really well. I find that taking notes about syntax and vocabulary are the most helpful for me. I take the most helpful notes right after I read the entire lesson once through.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I do lean into trying to solve the problem in code on my own first and then google if I get stuck.
